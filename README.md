        <h1>Next Word Predictor Using GRU</h1>
        <p><strong>Project Name:</strong> Next Word Predictor</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
        <p>The "Next Word Predictor" project utilizes a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model to predict the next word in a sequence of text. This type of model is a powerful tool in natural language processing (NLP) and is commonly used in applications like text auto-completion, chatbots, and language translation.</p>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>
        <p>The primary objective of this project is to build an NLP model that can accurately predict the next word in a given sentence or phrase using GRU, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). This project demonstrates the capabilities of GRUs in handling sequence data and generating coherent text predictions.</p>
        <p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Utilizes a GRU model for next word prediction.</li>
            <li>Trained on a large corpus of text to learn language patterns and context.</li>
            <li>Implements preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare text data.</li>
            <li>Provides an interactive interface for users to input text and receive next word predictions.</li>
            <li>Evaluates model performance using common NLP metrics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>TensorFlow/Keras for building and training the GRU model</li>
            <li>Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) for text preprocessing</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> The text data is cleaned and tokenized. This involves converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, and splitting into individual words.</li>
            <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> A GRU-based neural network is trained on the preprocessed text data to learn the patterns and structure of the language.</li>
            <li><strong>Prediction:</strong> The trained model takes a sequence of words as input and predicts the most likely next word in the sequence.</li>
